## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r functions,echo=T}
require(knitr)

df <- data.frame(A=c(1,2),B=c(4,2),C=c(3,4),D=c(8,7))
knitr::kable(df, 
             col.names = c("Space in name",
                           "(Special Characters)",
                           "$\\delta{m}_1$",
                           "Space in name"))

```
